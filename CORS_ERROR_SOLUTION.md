# CORS Error Solution

## Understanding the Error

The error you encountered:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://fit-pro-app.glitch.me/auth/login' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: Redirect is not allowed for a preflight request.
```

### What's Happening:

1. **Preflight Request**: When your browser makes a POST request with `Content-Type: application/json`, it first sends an `OPTIONS` request to check if the server allows cross-origin requests.

2. **Server Redirect**: The server at `https://fit-pro-app.glitch.me/auth/login` is responding to the `OPTIONS` request with a **redirect** (HTTP 3xx status code) instead of proper CORS headers.

3. **Browser Rejection**: Browsers explicitly **forbid redirects on preflight requests** as a security measure.

### Root Cause:

This is a **server-side configuration issue** with the `fit-pro-app.glitch.me` API. The server is not properly handling CORS preflight requests.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling

- Updated `authSlice.ts` to provide better error messages for CORS issues
- Added explicit CORS mode and credentials settings
- Added redirect detection

### 2. Proxy API Routes

Created Next.js API routes that act as proxies:

#### `/api/auth/login` (POST)

- Forwards login requests to `https://fit-pro-app.glitch.me/auth/login`
- Handles the request server-side, avoiding CORS issues
- Returns the response to the client

#### `/api/categories` (GET/POST)

- Forwards category requests to `https://fit-pro-app.glitch.me/api/categories`
- Handles both GET (fetch categories) and POST (add category) requests
- Preserves Authorization headers for authenticated requests

### 3. Updated API Endpoints

- Changed `API_ENDPOINTS` in `constants.ts` to use local proxy routes
- `LOGIN: "/api/auth/login"`
- `CATEGORIES: "/api/categories"`

## How the Proxy Solution Works

```
Client (Browser) → Next.js API Route → External API
     ↑                    ↓
     ← Response ← Response ←
```

1. **Client Request**: Your React app makes a request to `/api/auth/login`
2. **Server-Side Request**: Next.js API route makes the request to `https://fit-pro-app.glitch.me/auth/login`
3. **No CORS Issues**: Since the request is made server-side, there are no CORS restrictions
4. **Response**: The API route forwards the response back to your client

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No CORS Issues**: Server-side requests bypass browser CORS restrictions
2. **Better Error Handling**: More detailed error messages
3. **Security**: Can add additional validation and logging
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to switch APIs or add middleware

## Testing the Solution

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the login**:

   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
   - Try logging in with test credentials
   - Check the browser console for any errors

3. **Test the categories**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/categories`
   - Try fetching and adding categories

## Alternative Solutions (if needed)

### Option 1: Browser Extension

Use a CORS browser extension (for development only):

- Chrome: "CORS Unblock" or "Allow CORS"
- Firefox: "CORS Everywhere"

### Option 2: Different API Endpoint

If the current API continues to have issues, consider:

- Using a different API endpoint
- Setting up your own backend server
- Using a different authentication service

### Option 3: Server-Side Rendering

Move authentication logic to server-side components (Next.js 13+ App Router)

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get errors:

1. **Check the Network Tab**: Look for failed requests in browser dev tools
2. **Check Server Logs**: Look at the terminal where `npm run dev` is running
3. **Test API Directly**: Try accessing `/api/test` to verify the proxy is working
4. **Check External API**: Verify the external API is still accessible

### Common Issues:

1. **500 Internal Server Error**: Check if the external API is down
2. **401 Unauthorized**: Check if the token is being passed correctly
3. **Network Errors**: Check your internet connection

## Next Steps

1. Test the login functionality
2. Test the categories functionality
3. If everything works, you can remove the enhanced error handling (optional)
4. Consider adding rate limiting and caching to the proxy routes for production

The proxy solution should resolve your CORS issues while maintaining all the functionality you need.
